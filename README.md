# admin-dashboard

Made as an excercise for The Odin Project. It took way too long to get the elements to be responsive. 
The layout is a mix of mainly flex grids, but I got tired of using them and started using flex boxes for some elements part way through.

If I were to redo this project I would use flex boxes for the responsive elements and leave the flex grids for the overall page layout. 
There are numerous mistakes, and it took way longer than it should have, but it works and I'm happy for that.
